Multithreading is a process of excute multiple threads at the same time,
 without dependency of other threads.

java Language is Popular one of the reason because of this Multithreading.

"Thread is a pre-defined Class in Java, It is well known for 
independent Execution."



Creation Of Thread Class:

1) By Extending Thread Class.

ex:

class Multi extends Thread{  
public void run(){  
System.out.println("thread is running...");  
}  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Multi t1=new Multi();  
t1.start();  
 }  
}  


Output:

thread is running...


2) By Implementing runnable Interface.

ex:

class Multi3 implements Runnable{  
public void run(){  
System.out.println("thread is running...");  
}  
  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Multi3 m1=new Multi3();  
Thread t1 =new Thread(m1);   // Using the constructor Thread(Runnable r)  
t1.start();  
 }  
}  

Output:

thread is running...



The significant differences between extending Thread class and implementing Runnable interface:

1)When we extend Thread class, we can’t extend any other class even we require and
 When we implement Runnable, we can save a space for our class to extend any other class in future or now.

 2)When we extend Thread class, each of our thread creates unique object and associate with it. 
When we implements Runnable, it shares the same object to multiple threads.
